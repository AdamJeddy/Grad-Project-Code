# NLP Model - ASL to English  <!-- omit in toc -->

This repository contains the necessary components to train and run a deep learning model for translating American Sign Language (ASL) to English.

These are the folders:

## Data

The `Data` folder contains all of the datasets needed to train the model. It also includes scripts to pre-process the data, so that it is ready to be used by the model. Additionally, the Data folder holds an ASL book that provides information about the ASL signs used in the datasets.

## Model

The `Model` folder contains the code for the deep learning model. It includes all of the necessary dependencies for the model to run correctly. The code in this folder is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow framework. You'll also find all the necessary steps on how to run the script under in a ReadMe file.

## Notebook

The `Notebook` folder contains the code for training the model. The code is provided in a Jupyter notebook, which allows for an interactive and intuitive way to train the model. The notebook includes instructions for training the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python and TensorFlow installed on your machine. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can open the Jupyter notebook in the `Notebook` folder and follow the instructions to train the model. The trained model can then be used to translate ASL to English. If you want to test the model, under `Model` you'll find all the necessary steps.
